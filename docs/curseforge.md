The Legacy panel lists every challenge, but not which ones you can work on where you are. Legacy Forever puts that on the world map for the zone you're looking at, and keeps a small tracker of the challenges you pick. It uses the map's own buttons, menus, pins and the objective tracker, so it looks like it came with the game. It only adds to them: nothing the game or your other addons draw is replaced or hidden.

Discover an area and its shading lifts as the corner's percentage goes up. Click the corner to fold it away.

Half of Ashenvale explored: the shield's number is what's left on this map, and its menu lists it by challenge.

Zoom out and each zone with dungeon objectives left gets a badge.

Challenges you track sit beside the objective tracker, with live progress.

Tick a challenge in the menu to track it.

## Features

- **Map button** in the world map's button column: a Legacy shield with a number inside, the unfinished objectives on the map you're viewing. Its menu lists them by challenge, with a tick box to track each one.
- **Tracker**: a Legacy section beside the objective tracker lists what you track, with live progress. A zone ticked in the map menu tracks just that zone, such as "0/12 Explore Felwood". Click a challenge to open it in the Legacy panel.
- **Map pins** on dungeon and raid entrances, with the challenge each counts toward and its Legacy points. Click one for the game's own waypoint there.
- **Undiscovered areas** are shaded in their real shape on the zone map. Hover one to see which challenge counts it and how many of the zone's areas are left. The map menu turns the shading off.
- **Zone completion**, Guild Wars 2 style: how much of a zone's areas, dungeons, raids and Legacy objectives you've done, as a percentage in the map's corner and, if you tick it, the tracker. Flight paths, local reputations and, with Questie, quests can be added under "What counts". A finished zone gets a toast and a sound.
- **No fixed location** lists challenges whose remaining work isn't tied to a place, such as levels, skills and ranks.

Progress comes from the game each time, so it always matches the Legacy panel.

## Usage

Open the world map: the Legacy button sits below the map's own tracking buttons. Tick a challenge in its menu to track it.

- `/lf` opens the world map with the Legacy menu showing; `/lf help` lists the commands.
- `/lf audit` compares the bundled data with what the game reports. Found a wrong or missing objective? Include its output in an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/cjber/legacy-forever/issues).

It's in English for now. Translations are welcome as a pull request, or pasted into an issue, on GitHub: [Locales](https://github.com/cjber/legacy-forever/tree/main/Locales) has a template.

Locations are generated from the Forever client's own data and joined by ID (flight paths by the zone in their name); nothing is scraped from a database site.

It only shows what the game already tracks; it doesn't add challenges or change how they count.

Works with [Shortest Path Forever](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/shortest-path-forever), which plans the trip when you click a pin, and [Adventure Guide Forever](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/adventure-guide-forever), which shows your zone completion.
