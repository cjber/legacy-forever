"""Print a translation template: every phrase the shipped Lua translates, as a Locales/<locale>.lua file (stdlib only).

A phrase is the English text in `L["..."]`; the addon uses it as the key and falls back to it. The output is
committed as Locales/phrases.txt for translators to copy, and tests/locale_spec.lua fails when the two disagree.
Translation files themselves (Locales/) are not read, so a phrase the code no longer uses drops out.
